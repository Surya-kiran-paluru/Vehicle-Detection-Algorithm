Project title:
Vehicle detection algorithm.

Objective:
	Vehicle automation being the present trend in the technology, we aim to build a basic block of the main objective of vehicle automation that is object detection. Object detection is a process of identifying and analyzing a object. Our objective is to build a model that could detect vehicle in an image.

Scope:
	We aim to build a model that could detect vehicle in an image. We took dataset that is readily available via online. There are too complex models in the market we aim to make it a simple. The project is completed with in duration of 2 weeks where we worked on dataset loading and pre-processing in the first week and worked on training model in the second week.
